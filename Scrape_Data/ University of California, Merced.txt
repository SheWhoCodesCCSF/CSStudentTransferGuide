Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) Examination Note:  
AP and IB examination credit policies are detailed in the 2016-17 UC Merced
General Catalog, viewable online at:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*ALERT*  It is strongly recommended that you obtain a full transcript of your
academic records from each of the colleges and universities you have attended
before you start your UC application.  Applicants must report ALL grades, in all
courses--transferable and not transferable--from all institutions attended.
Applicants are solely responsible for the integrity of their self-reported
academic record in the UC application.
                                                                                
Applicants will not be competitive in the admission process if their academic
records show unsuccessful attempts of UC-transferable courses, as demonstrated
by one or more of the following:
                                                                                
   *  Multiple withdrawals in preparation for major courses, or                 
   *  More than one repeat of major preparation courses where grades of No Pass,
      D, or F were received or                                                  
   *  Unrepeated No Pass, D, or F grades in any UC-transferable course          
                                                                                
Following these guidelines will assist you to be more competitive for admission
to your UC Merced major.

The School of Engineering strongly discourages completion of IGETC as students
are encouraged to focus primarily on lower division major preparation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All course work must be completed with a letter grade of "C" or better.
