Questions regarding the major requirements listed above may be directed to the
Mathematics and Computer Science Student Service Center at (510) 885-4011. For
upper division (junior-senior) major and option requirements, please see the CSU
East Bay catalog or visit the department web site.
                                                                                
OTHER DEGREE REQUIREMENTS that can be completed prior to transfer:       
All transfer students must earn at least 60 transferable semester units.  Within
these 60 semester (90 quarter) units, students are strongly encouraged to
complete the following:
                                                                                
Lower Division Major Course requirements shown above.  Complete as many of the
lower division courses required for the major as possible.  Many of these
courses may be double counted as part of the lower division CSU GE-Breadth or
lower division IGETC requirements.
                                                                                
General Education requirements:  Complete all of the lower division CSU
GE-Breadth or the lower division IGETC requirements at the community college.
The approved courses for each area can be found at www.ASSIST.org under the
link "CSU GE-Breadth Certificate Courses" or "IGETC for UC and CSU" for your
college. Many of these courses can be double counted to meet the major
requirements shown above.  See your community college counselor for more
information in regards to having your General Education certified prior to
transfer.
                                                                                
Second Composition requirement can be satisfied by:  1) a course articulated
with CSU East Bay ENGL 1002; 2) an IGETC Area IB Critical Thinking course; or   
3) a second, if listed, certified for CSU GE Area A2 (IGETC Area 1A).  This     
course may meet a GE area requirement as well as the second composition
requirement.
                                                                                
American Institution requirement (US 1, US 2 and US 3):  This requirement is
normally completed with two courses and can be taken as part of your CSU        
GE-Breadth 39 semester unit requirements (GE Area D and sometimes Area C) or    
IGETC (GE Area 3 or 4).  The approved courses can be found at www.ASSIST.org    
under the link "CSU US History, Constitution, and American Ideals Courses" for
your college.  See your community college counselor for more information.
                                                                                
Cultural Groups/Women requirement:  A course that meets this requirement should
recognize the contributions to U.S. history or culture made by African
Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, women, or
gays/lesbians. The course must focus wholly, not partially, on the contributions
of the groups named above.  This course may meet a GE area requirement as well
as the cultural groups/women requirement.
                                                                                
Performing Arts/Activities requirement:  Courses in this area provide an 
opportunity to develop an appreciation of the visual and performing arts and    
physical activities through direct experience.  At least 40% of the class time  
in these courses must be activity or performance.  It is possible that this     
course may meet a GE area requirement as well as the performing arts/activities.
