GPA to a level of 3.40.  For non-TAG applicants to the College of Engineering,
the overall UC transferable GPA remains 3.10 or higher and the course group GPA
remains 3.20 or higher.  Be advised that future GPA requirements are subject to
change.

IMPORTANT ADVISORY FOR FALL 2017 APPLICANTS:                      
The College of Engineering will honor all engineering articulations effective
during the 2016-17 academic year.
                                                                                
Applicants for fall 2017 may also view ASSIST articulation agreements by major
effective during the 2015-16 academic year with the following exceptions:
Electrical Engineering majors are no longer required to complete the following
courses for admission selection:  Communication 1 or 3, Engineering 6, English 3
or University Writing Program 1. Mechanical Engineering majors are no longer
required to complete the following courses for admission selection:
Communication 1 or 3, Engineering 45, English 3 or University Writing Program 1,
Physics 9D. The College of Engineering strongly recommends that these admissions
selection course exceptions be completed if possible before transferring.
Students will still be required to complete these courses at UC Davis upon
transferring, as they are required for graduation.
                                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Advising Note:                                                   
                                                                                
All majors in the College of Engineering are selective and require preparatory
coursework for admission.  Transfer applicants must earn an overall transfer GPA
of 3.10 or higher to be competitive candidates for admission to any engineering
major. Strive to achieve your highest possible GPA in order to be most
competitive. Courses must be taken for a letter grade, with no grade less than
C. Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level
examinations may satisfy UC Davis course equivalents.
                                                                                
Transfer applicants must also complete all lower-division courses required for
their specific engineering major as listed below under courses "Required for
Admission" with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher for those courses completed
at the time of application and through the transfer academic update filing
period. Before submitting a UC application, students must have already achieved
a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher in required lower-division major coursework
completed.  If one course from the group is completed at the time the
application is submitted, the grade for that one course must be B+ or better. If
two or more courses from the group are completed at the time the application is
submitted, the GPA for those courses combined must be a 3.20 or higher.
                                                                                
Any required courses that are offered at your current college must be completed
by the close of spring term for fall enrollment at UC Davis.  If required
courses are not offered at your California Community College (i.e. those
identified on ASSIST as NO COMPARABLE COURSE or NO COURSE ARTICULATED), you must
complete them after enrolling at UC Davis.
                                                                                
In addition to completing preparatory courses for the major, students must also
meet UC transfer admission requirements by the close of spring term for fall
enrollment at UC Davis. In order to receive priority consideration it is
strongly recommended that transfer students complete UC transfer admission
requirements in English and mathematics by the end of fall term prior to
enrollment. Return to the previous screen for details.  Click on, "UC Transfer
Admission Eligibility Courses" and then select a UC transfer admissions
eligibility area.
                                                                                
IGETC:  Transfer students should place highest priority on completing all
requirements for their chosen engineering major.  By completing the
Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum(IGETC)however, the General
Education (GE) requirement at UC Davis will be totally satisfied for all UC
Davis GE requirements that may be met with lower-division courses.  Completing
IGETC is not required, nor does it improve the likelihood you will be admitted.
See additional GE information below.

For certain majors, the College of Engineering requires one English course as
part of its lower-division preparation. However, the University requires two
courses in English composition for transfer admission eligibility. When chosen
carefully, this second course could help satisfy general education requirements.
Please contact your college counselor or the UC Davis College of Engineering
Undergraduate Office at (530)752-1979 if you have any questions.

When there are more applicants than spaces available in the College of
Engineering, priority is given to California community college transfers who
have an overall UC transferable GPA of 3.10 or higher and who have completed all
lower-division engineering major requirements available at the student's
community college with a minimum GPA of 3.20 in these required courses. Contact
your counselor or the UC Davis College of Engineering Undergraduate Office
at(530)752-1979, or consult the College of Engineering website if you have
any questions.
