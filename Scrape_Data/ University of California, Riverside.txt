                        Articulation Agreement by Major                         
                    Effective during the 16-17 Academic Year                    
                Based on the 16-17 UC Transfer Course Agreement                 
     
            ====Computer Science with Business Applications B.S.====            
                                                                                
All majors in the Bourns College of Engineering are selective, based on academic
preparation and GPA in all transferable coursework, with a minimum GPA of 2.80.
(This is a baseline GPA for consideration and not a guarantee of admission).
                                                                                
As shown below, certain major course preparation is required prior to transfer,
with a GPA of at least 2.50 in the calculus sequence, and in at least one
additional sequence.
                                                                                
The Bourns College of Engineering (BCOE) accepts completion of IGETC as
satisfying the college's lower division general education/breadth requirements
for transfer students.  Additional upper division breadth requirements may be
required after enrollment in BCOE.  For more information on BCOE breadth
requirements, go to
http://student.engr.ucr.edu/policies/requirements/breadth.html
                                                                                
Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to focus instead on preparatory
course work for the major, such as the mathematics, science and other technical
preparatory course work listed below, rather than IGETC.  Strong technical
preparation is essential for success in the admissions process, and
subsequently, in all coursework at BCOE.

In addition to the required coursework above, students are strongly encouraged
to complete as much as possible of the additional lower division course
preparation listed below.  Completion of this coursework prior to enrollment
will faciliate a student's readiness for upper division work, allowing the
student to finish all degree requirements within two years of enrollment at UCR
(provided that satisfactory progress and a full-time study load is maintained).
