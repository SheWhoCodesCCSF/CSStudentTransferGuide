General advice: Transfer students are advised to complete the following  
courses for their major before enrolling at UC San Diego. Preparing well for    
the major helps students move efficiently toward graduation.                    
                                                                                
     - Calculus I-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20A)                       
     - Calculus II-for Science and Engineering (Math. 20B)                      
     - Calculus and Analytic Geometry (Math. 20C)                               
     - Linear Algebra (Math. 18)                                                
     - Two courses chosen from: Mechanics (Physics 2A), Electricity and         
       Magnetism (Physics 2B), General Chemistry I (Chem 6A), General Chemistry 
       II (Chem 6B), The Cell (BILD 1), Multicellular Life (BILD 2)             
     - Highest level of introductory computer programming language course       
       offered at the community college. For example, CSE 3, 5A, 7, and 8A may  
       be used to fulfill the lower-division elective requirement;              
       CSE 8B or 11 fulfill other lower-division requirements.
