 ASSIST: By Major Report 




                        Articulation Agreement by Major                         
                    Effective during the 16-17 Academic Year                    
                Based on the 16-17 UC Transfer Course Agreement                 
     
                         ====Computer Science, B.S.====                         
                      IMPORTANT INFORMATION--PLEASE NOTE:                
This articulation agreement lists course-to-course or sequence-to-sequence
substitutions for preparation in the major. Course exceptions permitted only for
a particular major are noted as "acceptable for substitution." As noted below,
completion of a specified subset of major preparation courses is required for
admission. In addition, transfer students are strongly advised to complete as
many of the remaining major preparation courses as possible prior to enrolling
at UCSB. Although completion of the remaining major preparation courses is not
an admission requirement, completion of these courses will help students move
more efficiently toward graduation after transfer.

ADMISSION SELECTION CRITERIA: Applicants to the Computer Science major who
complete the equivalent of all the REQUIRED UCSB major preparation courses and
as many of the STRONGLY RECOMMENDED courses as possible with a major GPA of 3.6
or higher are the most competitive for admission.
                                                                                
Applicants without all of the REQUIRED courses will be reviewed for admission,
but will have less competitive applications.
                                                                                
Courses for the major taken prior to admission must be completed with no grades
lower than "C".
                                                                                
REQUIRED base preparation courses:                                
-Math 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B                                                            
-Physics 1, 2, 3, 3L                                                            
-Computer Science 16, 24, 40                                                    
                                                                                
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED advanced preparation courses:                
-Computer Science 32, 64                                                        
-Math 6A                                                                        
                                                                                
You may attend more than one California community college to earn credit for the
required major preparation courses if the courses are not offered or if your
schedule constrains you from completing them at your own campus. However, it is
better to complete the physics series at a single school.

General Education Information:                                        
Students should focus on completing major preparation requirements. If time
permits, students may also take courses to fulfill either UCSB General Education
requirements or IGETC (Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum).
Students who will not complete IGETC prior to transfer should refer to the
College of Engineering General Education articulation agreement at
www.assist.org. UCSB's General Education requirements do not need to be
completed prior to transfer, but students who choose to follow College of
Engineering General Education should complete two to three General Education
courses prior to transfer. For more information concerning satisfaction of UCSB
General Education requirements, students may also refer to the College of
Engineering General University and General Education Program Requirements
handbook at http://engineering.ucsb.edu/prospective_undergraduates/publications/
