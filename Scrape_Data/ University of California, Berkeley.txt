Major Requirements:                                                      
Complete as many lower division major requirements as possible. See details on
preparation for this major below.
                                                                                
Primary selection criteria for admission, in general:                    
- completion of L&S Requirements (or IGETC), plus                               
- strength of academic preparation, and                                         
- grade point average.

Advice regarding courses in computer science:                            
                                                                                
The Computer Science department at Berkeley recognizes the fact that courses
comparable to Berkeley's computer science 61A-61B-61C series are difficult to   
find at most community colleges. With few exceptions, transfer students must    
take CS 61A during their first semester at Berkeley.                            
                                                                                
To be competitive for admission purposes, the department advises prospective    
transfer students to take UC-transferable courses in:                           
1) All equivalent Mathematics prerequisites:  Math 1A, Math 1B, and Math 54.    
2) Data structures--even if not officially comparable to Berkeley's CS 61B; and 
3) Java (preferred) or C++.                                                     
                                                                                
The entire Computer Science 61 series is also offered during the Berkeley       
Summer session.  The department recommends that, when possible, students take
one of these courses during the summer session prior to transfer.
                                                                                
If admitted, transfer students must achieve a 3.30 cumulative GPA in those
remaining prerequisite courses (CS 61A, CS 61B, and CS 70) taken at UC
Berkeley in order to petition for admission to the major.
                                                                                
Any course/s approved as comparable to COMPSCI 61B must include coverage        
of object-oriented programming, hashing, heaps, priority queues and graphs,
together with at least one programming assignment of 1000 or more lines
of code. If any of these topics is missing, the missing material may be acquired
by taking a bridge course, COMPSCI 47B, at Berkeley.
                                                                                
Any course/s approved as comparable to COMPSCI 70 must include coverage of the
following topics: propositional logic, proofs, mathematical induction; modular
arithmetic, gcd, polynomials over finite fields, applications to secret sharing
and error-correcting codes; discrete probability spaces, events, conditional
probability, Bayes' rule, random variables, expectation, variance, binomial,
Poisson and geometric distributions, Chebyshev's inequality, law of large
numbers, Bayesian inference; continuous random variables, density, exponential
and Normal distributions, central limit theorem; countability, diagonalization,
computability, the halting problem.
