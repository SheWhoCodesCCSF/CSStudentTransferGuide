# CSStudentTransferGuide
Comment from Sri(majumdarsr) in her pull request:
I have created..
1. schoolURL.txt to organize the school names against the webpages containing transfer information.
2. python code transferCriteria.py generated transferInfo.txt
3. transferInfo.txt has extracted relevent information from the school webpages.
We should be able to create a transfer guide table with the necessary info now.
